# How to use github 

Here are some commonly used commands 

- `git status` tells us what has happened since we last committed
- `git add` stages files to commit 
- `git commit -m "message"` this is how you commit a file. after -m you write what changes you just made.
- `git push` this pushes the file to the repository
- `git pull` this pulls the docs down from the repository. If multiple people are using the repo you should pull every time.
